<h1>Simple Linear Regression</h1>

<p>Simple linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between two variables: a predictor variable (X : Temperature ) and a response variable (Y : Revenue ). The goal is to find a linear equation that best fits the data, allowing us to make predictions about Y based on X.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Perform data visualization, plot the data points on a scatter plot to visualize the relationship.</li>
  <li>Draw a line of best fit that closely follows the trend of the data.</li>
  <li>Create Testing and Training dataset</li>
  <li>Train a simple linear regression model in Scitkit Learn</li>
  <li>Evaluate the model</li>
</ol>
